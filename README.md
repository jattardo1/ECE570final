How to Run:
In order to run the code you simply need to open up the ECE70_Demo.ipynb file in google colab and run it. 
The code will then ask you to upload a picture and if the picture is pixelated or not.

The compare.py file is ran by itself. If the user wanted to compare the two pictures then they have to upload them to the internet to get a URL for them and then paste the URL in the code to compare them. 
Use python3 compare.py to run once picture links are uploaded. 

CODE:
The code files that are labeled ECE70_Demo.ipynb and compare.py are the files writen by me and the rest are from the original GitHub (https://github.com/adamian98/pulse). The stylegan.py was altered a little by just changing the weights and the strides. 

StyleGAN was trained using Flickr-Face_HQ dataset
